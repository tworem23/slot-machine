# Emoji Slot Machine
The Emoji Slot Machine is a simple project I chose to hone my coding skills a little better. My project demonstrates what one can do with a basic understanding of the fundamentals of web development languages. There was no need to shoot for the stars with this game. The goal was to get comfortable playing with the wonderful applications of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
This slot machine toy I have created employs basic JavaScript strategies that demonstrate how a render function combined with an event listener can create something from nothing. I believe this slot-machine showcases how these combined coding languages can create an immersive, engaging website. Lets take a look.

Here you will see a spin button which you can click everytime a win or loss has been declared. When you get three like Emojis you will be declared a Winner!


The only thing missing would be some confetti or coins flashing on the screen when the win is declared. I would also like to add the spacebar to the event listener.
